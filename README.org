* Purpose

  This is the dotfiles that I used to develop web applications mainly using Ruby
on Rails and Vue. My main machine runs Mac OS X so instructions reflect that.

* Dependencies

As of July 31st of 2019, these are the packages need to get a new environment up
and running:

#+begin_src sh
  brew install \
    git \
    npm \
    reattach-to-user-namespace \
    sops \
    the-silver-searcher \
    tmux \
    vim \
    zsh
#+end_src

And I'm still making my mind on the following:

#+begin_src sh
  brew install editorconfig
#+end_src
